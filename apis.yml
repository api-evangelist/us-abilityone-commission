  The US AbilityOne Commission is a federal agency that administers the
  AbilityOne Program, which creates employment opportunities for individuals who
  are blind or have significant disabilities. By partnering with non-profit
  organizations that employ these individuals, the Commission helps them secure
  meaningful, competitive jobs in a variety of industries. The program also
  ensures that federal agencies prioritize purchasing products and services from
  these AbilityOne-affiliated organizations. Through its efforts, the US
  AbilityOne Commission promotes economic empowerment and independence for
  individuals with disabilities, while also supporting the federal government in
  meeting its procurement goals for goods and services.
